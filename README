Installing the face tracker.
============================

The installation has been tested on a PC with Windows 7 Enterprise, 64-bit and
another PC with Windows XP SP3, 32-bit.

The 32-bit face tracker runs in 32- and 64-bit Windows. The 64-bit facetracker
runs only under 64-bit Windows. It is advised to choose the 64-bit face tracker
if you have a 64-bit Windows, because it runs smoothest.

Java needs to be installed. If you have plans to recompile the face tracker's
source code, install jdk1.7.0_02 with the bitness of your choice if you have a
64-bit architecture, otherwise choose the 32-bit version. A run-time only
version of Java may work, but this has not been tested.

Download Anvil 5.0.23 from http://www.anvil-software.de/ and install the
software.

Copy the files in this distribution of the facetracker to the Anvil installation
folder, taking care that the destination directory names match with the source
directory names. There is a common folder anvil23-plugin for both 32-bit and
64-bit platforms and there are folders with 32-bit and 64-bit specific stuff:
* batch files for compilation of the facetracker and for running Anvil with
the facetracker
* compressed archives containing OpenCV and JavaCV libraries. The relevant 
compressed archive should be unpacked and its contents copies to the
Anvil/required folder.
* Microsoft redistributables

Install the Microsoft redistributables. The installation file is called
vcredist_x86 or vcredist_x64, depending on the architecture.

If you have both a 64-bit and a 32-bit Java, or if you have several
Javas with different version numbers, it may be necessary to specify 
the path to Java in the batch files for compiling and running. Open 
the files COMPILE_FACETRACKER.BAT and ANVIL_FACETRACKER.BAT in an editor.
(Right click | Edit). If you see a line starting with e.g. "jar", "javac"
or "java", the system's path information is used to find these programs.
You can specify the version of java by adding the full path, e.g.

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_02\bin\java"

Necessary preparations from within the Anvil UI
===============================================

Start Anvil by running the ANVIL_FACETRACKER batch file.

Editing the Anvil spec file
---------------------------

We now have to define tracks were the face tracker can dump its annotations.
There are two kinds of face tracker annotations: for velocity and for
acceleration. (Acceleration is the change of velocity with time and is caused
by some force, e.g. muscle forces or gravitation.)

Open the Specification Editor (Edit | Edit specification ...).
Velocity annotations are stored in a primary track with track attributes called
"velocity". Likewise acceleration annotations are stored in a primary track
with track attributes called "acceleration".

You can create as many velocity and acceleration tracks as needed in the
specification file.

Here's how:
1. Decide whether you want to create a new specification file 
        (File | Create new specification)
    or whether you want to edit an existing one.
        (File | Open specification | <browse and open>)

2. Decide where to put the new tracks. If you are creating a new specification
file, there is not much to choose. Click the word "Specification" in the track
pane. If you are editing an existing specification, you can choose
"Specification" or a group, the cursively spelled names in the track pane.

3. Press the Add Track/Group button and choose Add Track.

4. Choose a track name, for example "Velocity person 1". Primary track is
already OK.

5. Press the Add attribbute button.

6. Name must be "velocity" or "acceleration" (without the quotes). Type must
be Timestamped Point.

7. Save the specification file.

Add the face tracker plugin
---------------------------

Now you need to tell Anvil that it has a plug-in. (The plug-in used to be
detected automatically in older versions of Anvil.) Do the following:

1. Edit | Options ... | Plug-ins | add
2. Choose a name for the face tracker
3. In the next windows you are asked for the full class name of the plug-in
class. Write
    FaceTrackerAnvilPlugin
4. press OK twice to return focus to Anvil's main window.
5. Choose Tools | <name you have given to the facetracker in step 2.>
A new window opens with face tracker controls.

Running the face tracker
========================

Start Anvil by running the ANVIL_FACETRACKER batch file. Next you need to
open a movie and you need to activate the plugin, in either order.

Activate the Facetracker plugin
-------------------------------

* From the Edit menu, choose Options... . 
* Press the OK button.
* From the Tools menu, choose the factracker.

Opening a movie
---------------
 
The next step is to open and prepare a movie for annotation of head movements:
1. File | Open ... | <browse and open movie>
2. In the Annotation properties windows, browse to the specification file
you made earlier, open it and press OK

Getting started with the facetracker
------------------------------------

1. In the annotation window you choose the velocity or accelation track by
clicking its name.
2. If you do not want to annotate the movie from the start, navigate to the
frame where you want the annotation to start, and put the cursor about one
second before the startpoint.
3. In the Main Video window, point with the mouse pointer at the person's
face who's head movements you want to annotate.

If there is only one person, you can let the software find the face. You may
need to watch the annotation process as the software may lose track of the
face you had pointed at and be attracted to another person's face.

Now you can start the annotation process. You get the best results by letting
the software analyse each and every frame. To ensure that no frames are
skipped, you should let the face tracker step through the movie rather than
play the movie. Stepping is started by pressing the 'Step' button in the Face 
Tracker window. As the program starts to step, the text on the button face
changes to 'Stop', so pressing the button once again stops the movie.

Controlling the Facetracker
---------------------------

In the Face Tracker window are a number of sliders and buttons. The sliders
are per default set at positions that work well, so you can leave them as they
are if you want.

With the upper slider you can tell the algorithm on how many frames it has to
base the calculation of velocity or acceleration. The higher the value is set,
the smoother will the movements seem to be. Also, high values will tend to
erase very quick, subtle movements, because they will be averaged away. The
highest value, 25, corresponds to a full second at normal speed. If the value
is set much lower than 10, the inevitable errors in the estimates of the
face's position in each frame will likely generate many spurious movements and
consequently many false positive annotation elements.

The other two sliders set the sensitivity for horizontal and vertical
movements. The lower the threshold, the more annotations for velocity or
accelerations are generated, and the longer the stretch in time will be over
which a movement is perceived to take place. The face tracker can also be used
to annotate the stretches in the movie where little happens, e.g. the precise
moment where a movement has come to a stand-still. In that case a low value of
a threshold means that relatively few annotations will be generated.

There are also two check boxes in the face tracker window:

1. Suspend face tracking - select if you temporarily want to disable face
tracking, for example for seeing the movie at normal speed.

2. Annotate when velocity/acceleration is LOW - select this if you are
interested for the stretches where velocity or acceleration is low. 
(The latter could be the case if a person walks through the scene at
a constant velocity, provided she or he doesn't make hade movements at the
same time.)

There are four buttons in the face tracker window.

1. Step/Stop - press this button to start and stop a frame-by-frame analysis of
the movie. This is the prefered way to make automatic anotations, because it
is reproducible. Pressing the Play button plays the movie at normal speed,
which current hardware cannot keep up with: many frames will never be analysed.

2. Keep changes - press this button if you want to retain the settings for the
currently selected track. After pressing this button you can switch to another
track without Anvil forgetting the settings in the track you left, but
pressing this button does not save the settings to disk. When you later save
the annotation file to disk, the settings for each track individually will be
saved as well.

3. Cancel changes - press this button if you want to undo the settings you made
for the current track. Just switching to another track also cancels any such
changes.

4. Dismiss - close the face tracker
